     <p>Hello, I am Barbaro.  after having graduated 
     from technical school in Cuba for a long time, 
      my job was to fix desktop computers, but from a very young age. 
      I felt the desire to learn the magic of programming until it became an inescapable 
      desire almost 3 years ago. now  I live in the beautiful city of Austin,
       a place that opened its doors for me to make my dreams come true</p>
