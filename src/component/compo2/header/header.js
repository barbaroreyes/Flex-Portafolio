     <p> I am Barbaro and after having graduated from technical school in Cuba for a long time,
     my job was to fix desktop computers, but from a very young age I felt the desire to learn the magic of
     programming until it became an inescapable desire for almost 3 years I have lived in this beautiful 
     city of Austin</p>
